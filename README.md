Iterations: Added counters for each player of their available jumps and points. Added jump tokens that add 1 to the player's available jumps.
Added more platforms to add a challenge of high ground. I believe the limited jumps constrains the player so they have to think about when to jump more which allows them to go out and directly get more jumps.
The goals could be to wait and hog all the jumps or just attack the player while they're distracted getting the high ground.
Updated the jump counter and point counter to include player and color.
added player win condition which is 4 jumps.
made it so that when a player wins the player freezes and the game is stopped.
added a winning label that displays which player won.
modified platforms to make movement easier.
