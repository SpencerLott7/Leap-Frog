Iterations: Added counters for each player of their available jumps and points. Added jump tokens that adds 1 to the players avalible jumps.
Added more platforms to add a challenge of high ground. I believe the limited jumps constrains the player so they have to think about when to jump more and allows them to go out and directly get more jumps.
The goals could be wait and hog all the jumps or just attack the player while theyre distracted getting the high ground.
